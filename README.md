## Necessary Deliverables:

- **Proposal and Description**: 
- I chose to do a Chuck Norris themed API as I thought by building an application with funny jokes would make this project more fun and enjoyable to work on and also share a laugh with others.
- One of the major issues I had was due to the need to call upon the API to get a new joke, I had trouble getting to work the passing of a function to the components vs only on the App.js file. I think by having more practice working with React and API's, I could learn how to refactor this code base.
